The following packages are necessary:

libsdl2-ttf-2.0-0



Notes on installing from source:


                ==> libsdl2-ttf-2.0-0 <==

If this isn't in your package repositories (and none of the similarly-named
ones seem to work in its place), then you can build it from source. As of 15
Aug 2015, the source can be downloaded from:

    http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/

It requires FreeType to work. You probably already have that installed. If not,
you'll have to figure out how to get it (I already had it on my system). Once
you have FreeType, just download the source, unpack it, and do the standard
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install
