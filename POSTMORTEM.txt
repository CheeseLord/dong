Having all Entities in a giant list is not great. We should have named pointers
to interesting entites (ball, left paddle, right paddle) in addition. They
should be typed appropriately, so we don't need to dynamic-cast down from
Entity every time. Also/alternatively, maybe have lists that contain Entities
of a given type, in addition to the master Entity list? Ex: a Paddle list, a
Wall list.

Problem: components of an Entity store a reference to that Entity as an Entity,
not an appropriate subclass. This leads to, for example: the PaddlePhysics
needs to dynamic-cast its parent to a Paddle before it can get the max speed.
Proposed solution: just don't have a top-level PhysicsComponent class. Maybe
have an interface instead?

Control code is in gamestate.d. This is silly.
Proposed solution:
  * Initialize controllers to null (or some such) when we initialize the
    Entities, then create and attach actual controllers later, in a function
    InitControls in control.d.

Gamestate has too much in it
  * Separate gamestate into two modules. One contains the global definitions
    (including the scores and other structs currently in other files). The
    other contains the functions InitGameState, UpdateGame, and
    CleanupGameState.
